Hike is an evolution of the interpretive program begun by Walz and Rebecca Anderson in 1976. 
It has gone through many organizers, many directors, and amny name changes to become the
program that we offer today. For many decades the landowners In the Sutter Buttes allowed easy public
access to their ranches. By the 1960's, population growth lead to an overwhelming number of people
wanting to access the Buttes and problems with visitors.

We have emphasized a faith in the abilty of the people themselves to best protect and share the 
natural and cultural resources vital to the well-being of their communities. Our success depends 
upon a positive spirit of constructive collaboration. In seeking a way for the public interrest and
private land to converge for the benefit of all, we have always favored inclusiveness; the bringing
together private landowners and anyone who loves a natural environment.
